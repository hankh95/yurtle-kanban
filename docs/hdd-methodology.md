# Hypothesis-Driven Development: Applying the Scientific Method to AI Engineering

*A methodology guide for teams using yurtle-kanban to run rigorous, pre-registered experiments alongside their development work.*

**Last updated:** March 2026

---

Four out of five hypotheses failed. And it was one of the most productive weeks we've
ever had.

I'll get to that story. But first, the problem.

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

If you're building AI systems — agents, RAG pipelines, fine-tuned models, knowledge
graphs — you already know that unit tests are necessary and completely insufficient.

Tests tell you whether a function returns the right value. They can't tell you whether
your agent *understands* what it learned. Whether your orchestrator proposes sensible
work assignments. Whether knowledge that one agent learns transfers meaningfully to
another. These are system-level questions, and assert statements don't reach them.

Most teams handle this informally. You run the system, look at the data, find something
that looks good, and call it a win. The research community has a name for this:
*HARKing* — Hypothesizing After Results are Known. You look at the data, find something
promising, and retroactively frame it as what you were testing all along.

Nobody does this deliberately. But without pre-registered targets committed to version
control *before* data collection, there's no way to prove you weren't.

The evidence exists, but it's post-hoc and unfalsifiable. That's not science. That's
storytelling with numbers.

### Prior Art

HDD synthesizes established practices into a toolchain-integrated workflow:

- **The Lean Startup** (Ries, 2011) — Build-measure-learn loops with validated learning
- **Lean UX** (Gothelf & Seiden, 2013) — Hypothesis-driven product development
- **Evidence-Based Software Engineering** (Kitchenham et al., 2004) — Empirical research methods
- **Pre-registration** (Nosek et al., 2018) — Locking hypotheses before data collection
- **Design Science Research** (Hevner et al., 2004) — Artifact-centric research methodology
- **Test-Driven Development** (Beck, 2003) — Red-green-refactor discipline

What yurtle-kanban adds is the **integration**: hypotheses, experiments, and results
live in the same file-based, git-backed, graph-queryable system as the work items they
drive.

## What Hypothesis-Driven Development Actually Is

The cycle:

```
IDEA -> LITERATURE -> HYPOTHESIS -> EXPERIMENT -> ANALYSIS
```

1. **Capture the idea**: "Would entity linking help agents understand what they're reading
   earlier in training?"
2. **Review existing work**: What does the literature say? What targets are realistic?
3. **Formalize a hypothesis**: "Entity linking increases knowledge graph density by at
   least 15%." Specific. Quantitative. Stated in advance.
4. **Design and run the experiment**: Train one agent with the feature, one without.
   Compare. Measure.
5. **Analyze**: Did we hit the target, or didn't we?

The discipline lives in step 3. The hypothesis and its success threshold are committed
to version control *before* any data is collected. The research community calls this
**pre-registration**. It means you can't move the goalposts. You said 15%. Either you
hit it or you didn't.

### How It Differs from TDD

| | TDD | BDD | HDD |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit of work** | Function | Behavior | Hypothesis |
| **What you write first** | A failing test | A scenario spec | A falsifiable claim |
| **Pass criteria** | Assert equals | Gherkin steps | Quantitative target |
| **Output** | Working code | Working feature | Validated (or refuted) claim |
| **What a failure means** | Bug | Regression | Valid science |
| **Discovery phase** | None | None | Literature review |

Two differences matter. First: HDD starts with a question, not a test. Before you
formalize a hypothesis, you do a literature review — often LLM-assisted — to understand
what prior work exists and what targets are realistic. TDD assumes you know what to
build. HDD assumes you need to figure out what's even worth building.

Second: a refuted hypothesis isn't a bug. It's data. In TDD, red means "fix this." In
HDD, red means "now we know something we didn't know before." The teams that learn
fastest approach truth faster.

### The Critical Feedback Loop

**The goal of HDD is improved software, not papers.** Papers are documentation of
validated improvements — proof that an enhancement works.

Every experiment runs on a **feature branch** containing the implementation being tested:

```
HYPOTHESIS -> EXPERIMENT (on branch) -> RESULTS
                                          |
              VALIDATED -> merge branch -> improved software -> PAPER (optional)
              REFUTED -> learn -> NEW IDEA -> iterate
```

| Outcome | Action | Branch | Software Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **VALIDATED** | Merge to main | PR -> merge | Enhancement ships |
| **REFUTED** | Don't merge | Document learnings, close | No change, but we learned |
| **NEEDS-MORE-DATA** | Extend | Keep open | Continue experiment |

**Only validated enhancements ship.** We don't merge code we can't prove works. This
keeps the codebase clean and ensures every feature has evidence behind it.

## Worked Examples

### The Bloom Discovery: A Full Cycle

One of our early research questions: **"How do we measure whether an AI agent actually
understands what it knows?"**

Standard LLM benchmarks test recall. They ask a question, the model answers, you check.
But recall isn't understanding. An agent might score 92% and have no idea *why* any of
its answers are correct.

We captured the idea in 30 seconds:

> IDEA-R-002: "How do we measure agent cognition fairly?"

Then an LLM-assisted literature review. We asked: "Is there a standard in human
education for measuring understanding versus memorization?"

Answer: **Bloom's Taxonomy** (1956, revised 2001). Six cognitive levels. L1 is
Remember — recall facts. L2 is Understand — explain concepts in your own words.
L3 is Apply. L4 is Analyze. And so on up to Create.

The discovery that mattered: **no existing LLM benchmark tests L2, L3, or L4.** They
all test L1 recall with different question formats.

Hypothesis:

> H122.1: "Bloom-based assessment captures understanding gaps that standard
> benchmarks miss."

Experiment: assess the same agent on the same material with both approaches.

Results:

| Level | Standard Benchmark | Bloom Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| L1 (Remember) | 92% | 91% |
| L2 (Understand) | *not tested* | 67% |
| L3 (Apply) | *not tested* | 54% |
| L4 (Analyze) | *not tested* | 41% |

An agent scoring 92% on recall demonstrates actual understanding 67% of the time.
Applies knowledge in novel situations barely half the time. The standard benchmark
had zero visibility into any of this.

Hypothesis validated. That capability came from a 30-second idea, an afternoon of
literature review, and one well-designed experiment.

### When Four Out of Five Hypotheses Fail

The idea: **"Can agents predict what the user will ask next?"** Predictive processing.
We formulated five hypotheses with specific targets and ran them.

| Hypothesis | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| H118.1: Meaningful predictions | >=60% accuracy | 54% | **FAILED** |
| H118.2: Improves over sessions | +15pp over 10 sessions | +0pp | **FAILED** |
| H118.3: Surprise-driven gap detection | >=70% precision | 13.8% | **FAILED** |
| H118.4: Prediction calibration | ECE <15% | ECE = 45% | **FAILED** |
| H118.5: Trackable infrastructure | 136 tests pass | 136 pass | **VALIDATED** |

The plumbing worked. The cognition was fundamentally broken.

But we had something better than working code — **specific, documented failure modes.**
Each failed hypothesis pointed to a concrete structural problem. Then the insight: each
failure mapped to a known mechanism from **Beck's Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**
framework.

| Failure | Missing CBT Mechanism | Solution |
|---------|----------------------|----------|
| No improvement over time | No competing schemas | PredictionSchemaRegistry |
| Low precision | No distortion detection | DistortionDetector |
| Poor calibration | No dual processing | DualProcessPipeline |

Clinical psychology had already solved these problems — just not for AI systems. The
failures didn't tell us what was wrong. They told us **where to look for answers.**

Without HDD: build for months on conviction, discover problems too late, nothing to
show for it. With HDD: five tests in days, exact failure modes identified, immediate
redirect.

## The HDD Lifecycle in Detail

### Phase 0: Discovery

#### Capture the Idea (30 seconds)

Raw questions get captured immediately. Don't filter — capture everything.

**Two types of ideas:**

| Type | Prefix | Destination | Example |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Research** | IDEA-R | Hypothesis -> Experiment | "Entity linking might help understanding" |
| **Feature** | IDEA-F | Development board -> Code | "Add dark mode to dashboard" |

Research ideas enter the HDD pipeline. Feature ideas enter the kanban pipeline.

#### LLM-Assisted Literature Review

Before formalizing a hypothesis, survey what's already known:

| Stage | LLM Prompt Pattern | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Idea exploration | "Is there prior work on X?" | "Is there research on entity linking aiding comprehension?" |
| Framework discovery | "What standards exist for Y?" | "What frameworks measure cognitive levels?" |
| Hypothesis refinement | "How would we test Z?" | "How would we measure if Bloom captures more gaps?" |
| Measure selection | "What metrics are used for W?" | "What metrics assess reading comprehension?" |
| Analysis | "What explains this result?" | "Why might disambiguation accuracy be lower than expected?" |

#### Formalize the Hypothesis

Turn your discovery into a testable claim with a quantitative target.

**Format:** `H{paper}.{n}: [Specific claim] [quantitative target]`

**Quality checklist:**
- [ ] **Falsifiable** — there's a result that would refute it
- [ ] **Quantitative** — has a measurable target
- [ ] **Specific** — names the mechanism, not just the outcome
- [ ] **Scoped** — one claim per hypothesis (not a compound statement)

### Phase 1: Design

#### Experiment Protocol

Every experiment is a **reproducible protocol** with these required sections:

```markdown
# EXPR-{paper#}: Short Title

## Purpose
One paragraph: what question does this answer?

## Pre-Registration
- Hypothesis: H{paper}.{n}
- Primary outcome measure: M-XXX
- Target: [quantitative threshold]
- Analysis plan: [how you'll evaluate]
- Locked: [git commit hash] on [date]

## Method
### Participants / Agents
| Agent | Version | Role |
### Materials
| Item | Path | Count |
### Procedure
1. Step-by-step protocol
2. Including exact commands

## Run Command
(exact command to reproduce)

## Results
### Primary Outcome
| Measure | Target | Actual | Status |

## Analysis
How results support/refute hypotheses.
```

#### Measures

Every hypothesis needs at least one measure — a quantitative metric that determines
pass/fail:

| Category | What it measures | Examples |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| accuracy | Correctness of output | Entity disambiguation, routing agreement |
| performance | Speed/efficiency | Training throughput, inference latency |
| quality | Richness/depth | Semantic richness, confidence calibration |
| autonomy | Independence | Task autonomy score, escalation rate |

### Phase 2: Execution

#### Pre-Registration

Before running: commit the experiment file to git. The git hash serves as the
pre-registration timestamp. This prevents HARKing and post-hoc threshold adjustments.

```bash
# Lock the experiment design
git add research/experiments/EXPR-121-entity-linking-ab-study.md
git commit -m "pre-register: EXPR-121 locked before execution"

# Now run the experiment
```

#### A/B Experiment Pattern

For comparative studies:

| Element | Arm A (Control) | Arm B (Treatment) |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Agent | Identical config | Identical config + treatment |
| Data | Same | Same |
| Training | Standard | Standard + feature under test |
| Metrics | Collected | Collected |

The only difference between arms should be the variable under test.

### Phase 3: Analysis

Compare actual results to pre-registered targets:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **VALIDATED** | Target met or exceeded | Document, merge branch |
| **NOT SUPPORTED** | Target not met | Refine hypothesis or accept as negative result |
| **PRELIMINARY** | Partial data, trends visible | Continue data collection |
| **CONFOUNDED** | Design flaw discovered | Redesign experiment |

**A "not supported" result is valid science, not a failure.**

### Phase 4: Iterate or Publish

**If validated:** Document the result. The experiment file's Method and Results sections
should be directly reusable as paper content.

**If not supported:**
1. Was the target unrealistic? -> Adjust and re-run
2. Was the method flawed? -> Redesign the experiment
3. Was the hypothesis wrong? -> Document as negative result and publish anyway

### Statistical Rigor

For hypothesis validation, HDD uses pre-registered quantitative targets. There is no
universal p-value threshold — each hypothesis defines its own success criterion.

**Guidelines for setting targets:**

| Measure Type | Typical Target | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Accuracy | >=85% | Derived from entity disambiguation and NER literature (Kolitsas et al., 2018); adjusted for domain complexity |
| Improvement | >=15-30% | Must exceed measurement noise; 15% is minimum practical significance for graph-level metrics |
| Throughput | <5% degradation | Established SLA threshold — features adding >5% latency require architectural review |
| Coverage | >=60% | Below 60% the feature fails more often than it succeeds |

When a paper has 5+ hypotheses, acknowledge the multiple testing problem:
1. Pre-register a primary outcome (others are exploratory)
2. Consider Bonferroni correction for significance thresholds
3. Report all results transparently — don't hide non-supported hypotheses

## Tooling: yurtle-kanban

### Setting Up the Research Board

```bash
# Add an HDD research board alongside your development board
yurtle-kanban board-add research --preset hdd --path research/

# View both boards
yurtle-kanban board           # Development work
yurtle-kanban board research  # HDD research items
yurtle-kanban board --all     # Everything
```

### The HDD Cycle in Practice

```bash
# Phase 0: Capture an idea (30 seconds)
yurtle-kanban idea create "Would entity linking help early understanding?" \
    --type research --push

# Phase 0: Literature review
yurtle-kanban literature create "Entity linking for knowledge graphs" \
    --idea IDEA-R-007 --push

# Phase 1: Formalize a hypothesis (pre-registration!)
yurtle-kanban hypothesis create "Entity linking increases graph density >=15%" \
    --paper 121 --target ">=15%" --push

# Phase 2: Create experiment protocol
yurtle-kanban experiment create EXPR-121 \
    --hypothesis H121.1 --title "Entity linking A/B study" --push

# Phase 3: Run the experiment (timestamped, reproducible)
yurtle-kanban experiment run EXPR-121 --being my-agent-v2
yurtle-kanban experiment run EXPR-121 --being my-agent-v2 \
    --params "enrichment=wikidata,threshold=0.7"

# Check run history
yurtle-kanban experiment status EXPR-121
yurtle-kanban experiment status EXPR-121 --json  # For scripting
```

Each command creates the artifact from a template, allocates a unique ID, commits to
git, and pushes — atomically.

### Defining Measures

```bash
yurtle-kanban measure create "Graph Density" --unit percent --category accuracy --push
yurtle-kanban measure create "Reasoning Accuracy" --unit percent --category accuracy --push
```

### Validation and Cross-Referencing

```bash
# Generate a cross-referenced registry of all HDD artifacts
yurtle-kanban hdd registry

# Validate bidirectional links (papers <-> hypotheses <-> experiments)
yurtle-kanban hdd validate
yurtle-kanban hdd validate --strict   # Warnings = errors (for CI)
yurtle-kanban hdd validate --json     # Machine-readable output
```

The `hdd validate` command catches broken references: a hypothesis that claims to
belong to a paper that doesn't exist, an experiment missing its hypothesis link, a
measure referenced but never defined.

### Every File is Human-Readable and Machine-Queryable

Every artifact is a **Yurtle file** — markdown with RDF triples in fenced code blocks.
Humans read it in a text editor. Machines query it with graph operations. Same file,
two audiences, no synchronization problem.

A hypothesis file looks like this:

    ---
    id: H121.1
    title: "Entity linking increases graph density >=15%"
    status: active
    paper: 121
    target: ">=15%"
    created: 2026-02-15
    ---

    ```turtle
    @prefix hdd: <https://example.org/hdd/> .
    @prefix paper: <https://example.org/paper/> .

    <#H121.1> a hdd:Hypothesis ;
        hdd:paper paper:121 ;
        hdd:target ">=15%" ;
        hdd:status "active" ;
        hdd:measure "graph_density" .
    ```

    # H121.1: Entity Linking Increases Graph Density

    ## Claim
    Entity linking during ingestion increases knowledge graph density
    by at least 15% compared to baseline ingestion without entity linking.

    ## Success Criteria
    Graph density (edges / nodes) increases by >= 15%.

Below the frontmatter: plain markdown anyone can read. Inside the turtle block: RDF
triples you can query. "Show me all active hypotheses for paper 121." "Which experiments
have no results yet?" "What's the validation rate across all papers?"

### Git as the Arbiter of Truth

Before running an experiment, you write a file specifying: the hypothesis, the outcome
measure, the target threshold, the analysis plan, the exact command to reproduce. Then
you commit to git, record the hash, and only *then* start collecting data.

If someone challenges the results — "did you really set that target before you saw the
data?" — you point to the commit hash. Hypothesis committed at 2:00 PM. Data collection
started at 2:15 PM. Timestamps are immutable. Git is the arbiter.

You said 15% and got 12%? That's a refutation. Not "well, 12% is close." A refutation.
Document what you learned, create a new hypothesis with a refined target, test again.

### Dual-Board Architecture

yurtle-kanban supports multiple boards with different workflows. The standard pattern
for HDD teams is two boards:

```yaml
# .yurtle-kanban/config.yaml
boards:
  - name: development
    preset: software      # or nautical
    path: kanban-work/
    wip_limits:
      in_progress: 4
      review: 3

  - name: research
    preset: hdd
    path: research/
    wip_limits:
      active: 5           # Research can have more concurrent items
    phases:
      - discovery          # IDEA -> Literature review
      - design             # HYPOTHESIS -> Experiment protocol
      - execution          # Running experiment
      - analysis           # Comparing to targets
      - writing            # Drafting paper section

# Cross-board linking
relationships:
  implements:
    from_board: development
    to_board: research
    predicate: "expr:implements"
  spawns:
    from_board: research
    to_board: development
    predicate: "expr:spawns"
```

Research items don't count against development WIP limits. The boards are separate
workflows with separate rhythms, connected by cross-board relationships.

When an experiment validates a hypothesis, it spawns development work. When development
work surfaces a question, it spawns a new research idea. The research board is where
you figure out *what's worth building*. The development board is where you *build it*.

### Integrating with CI

```bash
# Add to your CI pipeline
yurtle-kanban hdd validate --strict

# Fails if:
# - Hypotheses reference nonexistent papers
# - Experiments missing hypothesis links
# - Papers with no hypotheses defined
```

---

## Agent Fleet Automation

For teams running AI agent fleets — multiple coding agents working in parallel —
yurtle-kanban's HDD workflow integrates with agent orchestration.

### The Automation Loop

```
Captain ranks priority queue
    -> Bosun (LLM orchestrator) proposes work assignments
        -> Fleet dispatch reads ranked queue, spawns agents
            -> Agents complete work, create PRs
                -> Cross-agent review
                    -> Merge, clean up, dispatch next item
```

The key insight: agent orchestration and HDD reinforce each other. The Bosun reads
experiment protocols and hypothesis files to understand *what* to test. The fleet
dispatch respects WIP limits and routes tasks based on capability (training work to
GPU machines, documentation to lighter hardware). Agents complete work in isolated
git worktrees, ensuring parallel safety.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

1. **Morning scan**: The Bosun reads all backlog items, research experiments, and fleet
   state. It proposes work assignments.

2. **Captain approval**: A human reviews proposals and ranks the priority queue. This
   is the human-in-the-loop that ensures agents work on the right things.

3. **Automated dispatch**: A cron job reads the ranked queue every 10 minutes. When WIP
   headroom exists, it spawns an agent in a tmux session with the expedition context.

4. **Agent execution**: The agent gets a focused prompt constructed from the expedition
   file, acceptance criteria, and fleet heuristics. It works autonomously — writes code,
   runs tests, creates a PR.

5. **Cross-review**: A different agent reviews the PR, checking for issues the
   implementing agent might have missed.

6. **Cleanup**: After merge, the monitor detects the completed session, cleans up the
   worktree, and frees the WIP slot for the next dispatch.

### Autonomous Agent HDD Workflow

HDD is designed to be followable by autonomous agents without human guidance. The
workflow is deterministic enough that an agent can:

1. Receive a research question
2. Conduct a literature review
3. Formalize hypotheses with quantitative targets
4. Design an experiment protocol
5. Execute the experiment
6. Analyze results against targets
7. Draft paper sections from the results

Every decision point has a clear default. Agents don't need to ask "what should I
measure?" — the hypothesis specifies the target, the measure defines how to collect
data, and the experiment protocol defines the exact commands.

---

## What We've Learned Running HDD in Production

After 18 months of HDD across 29 research papers and 80+ formal measures:

**Pre-registration prevents wishful thinking.** Before HDD, we'd run the system, look
at the data, and declare success based on whatever looked good. Now we state targets
first. It's uncomfortable. It's honest.

**Negative results are your most valuable data.** The 4/5 failure on predictive
processing was more productive than many successes. Each failure pointed to a specific
missing mechanism.

**Metrics should be boring.** Fleet dashboard shows: approval rate 86%, spawn
success 95%, targets met. No excitement. That's the point.

**Speed demands structure.** Agentic development is *fast* — three agents can ship
four features before lunch. That speed is intoxicating and dangerous. HDD prevents
shipping conclusions before the evidence is in.

**Refutations compound.** A pattern of refutations across related hypotheses reveals
structural gaps no individual test could surface.

---

## Getting Started

### Minimal Setup

```bash
# Install
pip install yurtle-kanban

# Initialize with HDD support
cd my-project
yurtle-kanban init --theme software
yurtle-kanban board-add research --preset hdd --path research/

# Start your first HDD cycle
yurtle-kanban idea create "Does X improve Y?" --type research --push
```

### The Three Rules

1. **State the target before collecting data.** Commit the hypothesis file to git
   before running the experiment. This is non-negotiable.

2. **Accept refutations as learning.** A refuted hypothesis is not a failure — it's
   data that tells you where to look next.

3. **Keep the cycle short.** IDEA -> HYPOTHESIS -> EXPERIMENT -> ANALYSIS should take
   days, not months. If it takes longer, your hypotheses are too broad.
