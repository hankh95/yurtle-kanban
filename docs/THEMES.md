## Theme Details

### Software Theme (default)

Standard software development terminology. Best for teams familiar with agile/scrum.

| Type | Prefix | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Feature | FEAT- | New functionality |
| Bug | BUG- | Defects to fix |
| Epic | EPIC- | Large multi-feature initiatives |
| Task | TASK- | Small work items |
| Idea | IDEA- | Proposals for consideration |
| Chore | CHORE- | Maintenance and cleanup |

### Nautical Theme

Maritime metaphor for project work. Used by NuSy and teams who prefer the voyage metaphor.

| Type | Prefix | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Voyage | VOY- | Strategic multi-month goals |
| Expedition | EXP- | Time-boxed deliverable work |
| Hazard | HAZ- | Problems requiring resolution |
| Signal | SIG- | Observations and opportunities |
| Chore | CHORE- | Maintenance and cleanup |

**Why Nautical?**
- Voyages have clear destinations (goals)
- Expeditions have defined scope and timeframes
- Hazards are actively navigated around
- The ship metaphor encourages thinking about resources, crew, and coordination

### Spec Theme

Specification-driven development. Best for teams using RFCs, ADRs, and formal specs.

| Type | Prefix | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| RFC | RFC- | Request for Comments - proposals |
| Spec | SPEC- | Specifications for implementation |
| Issue | ISSUE- | Problems or bugs |
| Task | TASK- | Implementation work |
| Spike | SPIKE- | Research and investigation |
| ADR | ADR- | Architecture Decision Records |

**Why Spec-Driven?**
- Clear separation between design (RFC/Spec) and implementation (Task)
- ADRs document why decisions were made
- Spikes explicitly allocate time for research
- RFCs encourage discussion before commitment

## Choosing a Theme

| If your team... | Use |
|-----------------|-----|
| Uses agile/scrum terminology | `software` |
| Prefers metaphorical thinking | `nautical` |
| Does formal design-first development | `spec` |
| Has existing vocabulary | Create a custom theme |
